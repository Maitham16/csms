    Project Documentation

    The first step should be to lay out a clear documentation detailing what each 
    microservice does, how they interact, and what their APIs will look like. This 
    will include:

    a. Identify the Microservices: Determine what functionalities should be split into 
    separate services. In the context of an eShop, we might have an inventory service, 
    an order service, a user service, and so on.

    b. Define the APIs: Define how each service will expose its functionalities. 
    This will include the API endpoints and their inputs/outputs. ASP.NET Core, coupled 
    with Swagger, can be great for this.

    c. Define the Data Schema: Each service should have its own database. Define what data 
    is stored where.

    d. Define the Communication: Specify how the services will communicate with each other. 
    This may include using HTTP/REST, gRPC, or a combination of both. You may also want to 
    include some kind of message bus (like RabbitMQ or Azure Service Bus) for asynchronous 
    communication.

    e. Define the Authentication/Authorization Strategy: This is especially important in a 
    distributed system like a microservices architecture. You might use IdentityServer, JWT, 
    or another system.

    Implementing the Microservices

    Once the documentation is complete, we can start creating the microservices based on our 
    design. The typical flow might look something like this:

    a. Set Up the Development Environment: This includes your local machine and the broader 
    development infrastructure. Visual Studio Code, Docker, and .NET Core SDK are just a 
    few of the tools that will likely be needed.

    b. Create the ASP.NET Core Projects: For each microservice, create a new ASP.NET Core 
    project. Then implement the business logic and data access layers.

    c. Implement the APIs: For each microservice, implement the APIs defined in your 
    documentation. Test the APIs to ensure they're working correctly.

    d. Dockerize the Services: For each microservice, create a Dockerfile that describes 
    how to build a Docker image for that service. Then build and test the Docker images.

    e. Implement the Communication: Set up the communication between your services. This 
    might involve setting up a message bus, or implementing HTTP/gRPC communication.

    Testing and Deployment

    After all the microservices are complete, it's time to test and deploy them:

    a. Set Up the Deployment Environment: This will probably involve setting up a Kubernetes 
    cluster. This could be on a cloud provider or on-premise.

    b. Deploy the Services: Deploy the Docker images for each service to your Kubernetes 
    cluster. Then test to make sure everything works as expected.

    c. Implement Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Automate the testing 
    and deployment of your services. This way, every time you make a change to the code, 
    it gets tested and deployed automatically.

    Monitor and Update

    Once everything is up and running, it's important to keep an eye on your services to 
    ensure they're running smoothly. Implement some form of logging and monitoring for your 
    services. Also, be prepared to update your services as needed based on feedback and 
    changing business requirements.

This should give you a broad outline of how to approach this project. Of course, each of 
these steps is a project in itself, and there's a lot to learn along the way!
