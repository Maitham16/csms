1- First we built the scenario.
2- We built the relationships between Microservices.
3- We decided which Microservices need a database and what kind of database are we going to use.
4- We specified the API endpoints for each Microservice (We may need to change them later).
5- We specified the Request and Response for each endpoint as JSON.
6- We specified the HTTP methods for each endpoint (as in RESTful API).
7- We specified a Message Broker for each Microservice (RabbitMQ).
8- We decide to use (OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect) for Authentication and Authorization.
9- We decided to use for testing (Unit Testing / Integration Testing / End-to-End Testing)
   and later we will decide which tools we are going to use.
10- Deployment Strategy: We decided to use (Docker / Kubernetes) for containerization.
                         We decided to use (CI/CD Pipelines) for Continuous Integration and 
                         Continuous Delivery (Github).
11- We will decide later which tools will be used for monitoring and logging.
